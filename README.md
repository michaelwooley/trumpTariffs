# Trump Tariffs

_6 March 2018_


## Questions

1. What workers will be most- and least-affected by the tariffs?
1. Where are these workers located?
1. What share of GDP do affected industries represent in terms of:
  - Income in affected areas/U.S.?
  - GDP in economy?
1. What industries are most dependent on imported inputs?
1. Where are particular inputs mostly sourced?

### Related to Policies

1. What sort of retaliatory tariffs are likely to arise?
1. What does the second round look like?


## Ideas

### Mapping Effects

Maps of:

- Location of steel/aluminum workers
- Location of downstream workers

Do this both in absolute terms and as share of U.S. and county labor force.

_DATA_ on location of workers can be had from 5-year ACS. 

How to define downstream workers? Can do first- and infinite-order definition of input shares. Definitely once get to infinite-order input shares the graph will be connected. Can graph as median input share of steel/aluminum among all workers in county.

Alternatively, could try to compute potential change in labor demand due to tariff. Add production networks to [DFS](http://web.econ.ku.dk/nguyen/teaching/DFS1977.pdf)?
