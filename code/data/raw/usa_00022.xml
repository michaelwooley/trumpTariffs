      <txt><![CDATA[DATANUM identifies the particular sample from which the case is drawn in a given year. For most censuses, the IPUMS has multiple datasets available which were constructed using different sampling techniques (i.e. size/demographic of the sample population, geographic coverage level or location, or duration of the sampling period for the ACS/PRCS samples).

The 1970 samples present a special case; in addition to geographic coding differences, the samples were drawn from two distinct questionnaires ("long forms"), referred to in the IPUMS as Form 1 and Form 2. Different questions were asked of the persons in the Form 1 and Form 2 samples, necessitating separate treatment in the record layout. For other census years, DATANUM has a value of 1 because only one sample is available for that year.

The availability table for each variable indicates whether that variable is available in only certain samples for a given year. For further discussion of sample differences, see "Sample Designs." [URL omitted from DDI.]]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HHWT indicates how many households in the U.S. population are represented by a given household in an IPUMS sample. 

It is generally a good idea to use HHWT when conducting a household-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of HHWT is optional when analyzing one of the "flat" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. HHWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for household-level analyses of any sample other than those.

Users should also be sure to select one person (e.g., PERNUM = 1) to represent the entire household.

For further explanation of the sample weights, see "Sample Designs" [URL omitted from DDI.] and "Sample Weights" [URL omitted from DDI.]. See also PERWT for a corresponding variable at the person level, and SLWT for a weight variable used with sample-line records in 1940 1% and 1950.]]></txt>
      <codInstr><![CDATA[
HHWT is a 6-digit numeric variable which indicates how many households in the U.S. population are represented by a given household in an IPUMS sample and has two implied decimals. For example, a HHWT value of 010461 should be interpreted as 104.61. HHWT specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below if applicable by Census year (and data sample if specified).

User Note: Users should also be sure to select one person (e.g., PERNUM = 1) to represent the entire household when using HHWT.

      <txt><![CDATA[COUNTY identifies the county where the household was enumerated, using the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) coding scheme. Counties are assigned codes alphabetically within states. The first 3 digits are usually identical to the FIPS county codes used in other datasets; ICPSR adds a digit to the FIPS codes to accommodate change over time. In general, if a county merged with another or was renamed before 1970, it receives an extra digit of 5. Like STATEICP, COUNTY facilitates merging IPUMS data with ICPSR data. COUNTY also identifies areas that were not part of any county, including the independent cities of Virginia and some Indian lands. COUNTY is a state-dependent variable; it must be read with one of the STATE variables (STATEICP, STATEFIP) to distinguish among counties located in different states. 

Many county boundaries and some county names changed over time. The IPUMS does not impose a uniform county boundary system on the data, so a particular county listed for a given year in the IPUMS should be assumed to have the boundaries that it had in that year. 

Counties are unavailable in public-use microdata from 1950 onwards. However, it is possible to recover some counties from low-level geographic identifiers. These include State Economic Areas (SEA) in 1950; county groups in 1970 (CNTYGP97) and 1980 (CNTYGP98); and Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMA) from 1990 onwards, including Super-PUMAs (PUMASUPR) in 2000 (COUNTY cannot be constructed for 1960 1 % because geographic information below the state level is not currently available).  Counties were identifiable if:
they were coterminous with a single identifiable SEA, county group, or PUMA; or
they contained multiple identifiable SEAs, county groups, or PUMAs, none of which extended into other counties. In this way, COUNTY identifies counties only for residents of areas that lie entirely within a single metro area, which prevents errors of commission (no non-residents of a county are identified as residents), but it puts no limit on errors of omission (sizable portions of some counties' populations are not identified by COUNTY).

An Excel spreadsheet [URL omitted from DDI.] provides a list of counties and their corresponding ICPSR and FIPS codes available in each year from 1950 onwards.

For municipios, the Puerto Rican statistical equivalent of U.S. counties, enumerated in the 1910-1920 Puerto Rican census, see PRCOUNTA (for an alphabetic version) and PRCOUNTY (for a numeric version).

User Note:
IPUMS COUNTY codes for Maryland and Nevada depart from the FIPS coding scheme.  For Maryland, all FIPS codes of 009 and higher (excluding Baltimore City, which is coded as 5100 for IPUMS and 510 for FIPS) are shifted down by two in the IPUMS data. For example, Calvert County is coded as 009 in the FIPS coding scheme, but 0070 in the IPUMS samples.  

Pershing County, Nevada is assigned FIPS code 270, while historical Ormsby County, Nevada uses FIPS code 250.  In the IPUMS samples, Pershing County is instead coded as 0250 and cases from Ormsby County are coded into the Carson City county code of 0510.  The historical Riovirgin County takes on county code 0270 in the IPUMS coding scheme.

Users will need to adjust the IPUMS codes to match the FIPS codes when merging in data from other sources.]]></txt>

COUNTY is a 4-digit numeric variable that identifies the county where the household was enumerated using the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) coding scheme. Counties are assigned codes alphabetically within states. Like STATEICP, COUNTY facilitates merging IPUMS data with ICPSR data. COUNTY also identifies areas that were not part of any county, including the independent cities of Virginia and some Indian lands. COUNTY specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below if applicable by Census year (and data sample if specified).

User Note: COUNTY is a state-dependent variable; it must be read with one of the STATE variables (STATEICP, STATEFIP) to distinguish among counties located in different states.

      <txt><![CDATA[PUMA identifies the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) where the housing unit was located. In the 1990 State sample, PUMAs generally follow the boundaries of county groups, single counties, or census-defined "places". If these areas exceed 200,000 residents, they are divided into as many PUMAs of 100,000+ residents as possible. None of the 1990 State sample PUMAs cross state lines. For the 1990 Metro sample, PUMAs generally follow the boundaries of whole central cities, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas, or non-metropolitan places (See METAREA for definitions of these terms). If these areas exceed 200,000 residents, they are divided into as many PUMAs of 100,000+ residents as possible. 1990 Metro sample PUMAs sometimes cross state lines; when they do, STATEFIP and STATEICP codes are not available for households in those PUMAs. PUMAs in the 2000 census, 2010 census, and the 2005-onward ACS/PRCS also consist of 100,000+ residents, and they do not cross state lines.

Note that PUMA is state-dependent. The codes must be read in combination with one of the STATE variables (STATEFIP or STATEICP). PUMAs are categorized by type (e.g., metropolitan, mixed metro/nonmetro, non-metropolitan) in the variable PUMATYPE. PUMA is similar to the county group variables, CNTYGP97 (1970) and CNTYGP98 (1980), and the State Economic Area variable (SEA) for 1940 and 1950.

Note Regarding Multi-Year Samples: The Census Bureau redraws PUMA boundaries every 10 years based on population information gathered from the most recent decennial census. ACS samples incorporate the new PUMAs within a few years of the Decennial Census. See the comparability statement to see which PUMAs are used in each sample. In Multi-Year ACS files, PUMA boundaries depend on the original year the respondent was interviewed (see MULTYEAR). For example in the 2010-2012 3-year ACS sample, respondents from 2010 and 2011 correspond to the Census 2000 based PUMAs, while respondents from 2012 correspond to the Census 2010 based PUMAs.]]></txt>

PUMA is a 5-digit numeric variable identifying the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) where the housing unit was located. PUMAs are categorized by type (e.g., metropolitan, mixed metro/nonmetro, non-metropolitan) in the variable PUMATYPE. PUMA is similar to the county group variables, CNTYGP97 (1970) and CNTYGP98 (1980), and the State Economic Area variable (SEA) for 1940 and 1950. PUMA specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below by Census year (and data sample if specified).

User Note: PUMAs are drawn and coded differently for the 1990 State and Metro samples. In the 1990 State sample, PUMAs generally follow the boundaries of groups of counties, single counties, or census-defined "places". If such areas exceed 200,000 residents, they are divided into as many PUMAs of 100,000+ residents as possible. None of the 1990 State sample PUMAs cross state lines. In the 1990 Metro sample, PUMAs generally follow the boundaries of whole central cities, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas, or non-metropolitan places (See METAREA for definitions of these terms). If these areas exceed 200,000 residents, they are divided into as many PUMAs of 100,000+ residents as possible. 1990 Metro sample PUMAs sometimes cross state lines; when they do, STATEFIP and STATEICP codes are not available for households in those PUMAs. PUMAs in the 2000 census, 2010 census, and the 2005-onward ACS/PRCS also consist of 100,000+ residents, and they do not cross state lines.

User Note: PUMA is state-dependent, therefore the codes must be read in combination with one of the STATE variables: STATEFIP or STATEICP.

User Note: In the 2006-2011 ACS, persons living in Louisiana PUMAs 01801, 01802, and 01905 were all coded as living in Louisiana PUMA 77777. This is because these three PUMAs no longer had sufficient population to be included as separate entities due the effects of hurricane Katrina.]]></codInstr>

      <labl>Group quarters status</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[GQ classifies all housing units as falling into one of three main categories: households, group quarters, or vacant units. It also identifies fragmentary sample units for 1850-1930 (see below). In all years, the data available about a person and their co-residents depend on whether the person lives in a household or in group quarters. Households are sampled as units, meaning that everyone in the household is included in the sample, and most household-level variables are available. People living in group quarters are generally sampled as individuals; other people in their unit may or may not be included in the sample, and there is no way of linking co-residents' records to one another. If, however, a sampled person in group quarters was living with relatives, the related group was sampled for 1850-1930. Most household-level variables are not available for group quarters or for vacant units.

Group quarters are largely institutions and other group living arrangements, such as rooming houses and military barracks. The definitions vary from year to year, but the pre-1940 samples have generally used a definition of group quarters that includes units with 10 or more individuals unrelated to the householder. See the comparability discussion below and "Sample Designs" [URL omitted from DDI.] for more details about changing definitions of group quarters.  Group-quarters types are identified in further detail by GQTYPE and GQFUNDS.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[PERWT indicates how many persons in the U.S. population are represented by a given person in an IPUMS sample. 

It is generally a good idea to use PERWT when conducting a person-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of PERWT is optional when analyzing one of the "flat" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. PERWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for person-level analyses of any sample other than those.

For further explanation of the sample weights, see "Sample Designs" [URL omitted from DDI.] and "Sample Weights" [URL omitted from DDI.]. See also HHWT for a corresponding variable at the household level, and SLWT for a weight variable used with sample-line records in 1940 and 1950.]]></txt>
      <codInstr><![CDATA[
PERWT is a 6-digit numeric variable which indicates how many persons in the U.S. population are represented by a given person in an IPUMS sample and has two implied decimals. For example, a PERWT value of 010461 should be interpreted as 104.61. PERWT specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below if applicable by Census year (and data sample if specified).

Users studying change over time must adjust for inflation. Consumer Price Index adjustment factors for the appropriate years can be found in the CPI99 variable.

The exception is the ACS/PRCS multi-year files, where all dollar amounts have been standardized to dollars as valued in the final year of data included in the file (e.g., 2007 dollars for the 2005-2007 3-year file). Additionally, more detail may be available than exists in the original ACS samples.

User Note: ACS respondents are surveyed throughout the year, and amounts do not reflect calendar year dollars. While the Census Bureau provides an adjustment factor (available in ADJUST), this is an imperfect solution. See the ACS income variables note [URL omitted from DDI.] for further details.
